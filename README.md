# PythonProgrammingLab
All Program of 6th Sem Python Programming Lab. These Program includes the explaination & basics of lists, tuples, data-types, functions, dictionary, loops, operators, sorting methods, strings & sets etc.
## Introduction to RTU Python Programming Lab (for README)
The Python Programming Lab at Rajasthan Technical University (RTU) is designed to introduce students to the fundamentals of Python, a versatile, high-level, interpreted programming language widely used in academia and industry. This lab provides hands-on experience to help students understand core programming concepts, develop problem-solving skills, and gain proficiency in writing, testing, and debugging Python programs.

### Purpose and Scope
- To familiarize students with Python’s syntax and semantics through practical exercises.
- To develop a strong foundation in programming constructs such as data types, operators, control flow (loops and conditionals), and functions.
- To explore Python’s built-in data structures including lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries.
- To teach modular programming using functions and modules.
- To introduce file handling, regular expressions, and basic object-oriented programming concepts.
- To enable students to write efficient and readable Python code for solving real-world problems.

### Learning Outcomes
By the end of this lab course, students will be able to:
- Write, test, and debug Python programs using both interactive shell and script modes.
- Implement decision-making and looping constructs to control program flow.
- Use Python’s data structures effectively to store and manipulate data.
- Define and invoke functions and organize code into reusable modules.
- Perform file input/output operations and handle exceptions.
- Apply regular expressions for pattern matching and data validation.
- Understand and implement basic object-oriented programming concepts such as classes and objects.

### Lab Environment and Tools
- Python versions 2.7.x, 3.6.x, or later are used depending on the curriculum.
- Programming is typically done using IDLE (Python’s Integrated Development and Learning Environment), command-line interface, or other IDEs.
- The lab environment supports Windows, macOS, and Linux platforms.

### Importance of the Lab
This lab bridges theoretical programming concepts with practical implementation, enabling students to visualize and experiment with Python code. It prepares students for advanced programming courses and equips them with skills relevant to software development, data analysis, automation, and other computing fields.
